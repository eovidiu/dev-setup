# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a development setup repository currently in its initial stages. The repository structure and tooling will evolve as the project develops.

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal structure with:
- `requirements` - Empty file, likely intended for Python dependencies

## Development Workflow

This section will be populated as build, test, and development commands are established.

- No commits yet - this is a fresh repository
- Development practices and architecture will be documented here as they are established

## Active Technologies
- Shell scripting (Bash/Zsh) for orchestration, Dockerfile for image definition + OrbStack for containerization (chosen for macOS performance and native Apple Silicon support) (001-isolated-dev-env)
- Container volumes for isolated filesystem, bind mounts for host code access (001-isolated-dev-env)
